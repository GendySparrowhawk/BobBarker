## Usage
using JavaScript paired with HTML and css, Bob Barker can quickly load questions, check for scores.

# keeps time
once you click start a timer will count down. Each wrong answer takes 5 seconds off your time!

# logs scores
Each corrrect answer is ten points. At the end of each game you will be asked to enter your name for the highscore tracker using JSON and local storage. 

# how much junk stays in your brain
I can barley remebr my uncles names but I will never forget the fact that actual lives have been claimed by the chicken-sandwich wars! Test your limits, I know these thigns and now you have to!
